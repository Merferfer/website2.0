<p>I do not know anyone that works as a hardware engineer, but my dad works as a Senior Network Engineer at Manassas Schools. He would bring me into
all of the server rooms and let me unpack some of the computers that would be given to students. He went to a computer school to get his education.</p>

is money, because it helps you keep up with fast changing technology.</p>
